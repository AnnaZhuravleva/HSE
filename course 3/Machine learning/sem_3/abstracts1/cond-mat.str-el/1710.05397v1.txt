We propose and demonstrate the use of periodic uniform Matrix Product States (puMPS) to extract conformal data from a critical quantum spin chain and to study its RG flow non-perturbatively. Given a microscopic lattice Hamiltonian, its ground state is approximated by a puMPS, whereas low energy excited states are approximated as puMPS Bloch states. Conformal data is then extracted from these low energy states by computing the energy-momentum spectra and from matrix elements of the (Koo-Saleur) lattice Virasoro generators, as recently outlined in [Milsted, Vidal, arXiv:1706.01436]. The spectral RG flow is studied by monitoring the low-energy spectrum of a fixed microscopic Hamiltonian for a sequence of increasingly large chains, ranging from a few spins to several hundred spins. As an example we consider a flow in the Axial Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model that mimics the RG flow interpolating between the Tri-Critical Ising CFT in the UV and the Ising CFT in the IR.
