The density functional theory (DFT)+$U$ method is a pragmatic and effective approach for calculating the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated systems. Linear response calculations have become a widespread technique for determining Hubbard parameters from first principles. We provide a detailed treatment of spin in the context of linear response calculations. We construct alternative definitions for Hubbard and Hund's parameters that are consistent with the contemporary DFT+$U$ functional, but which yield lower values for $U$ than the standard, spin-independent approach. We have tested these on a complete series of transition-metal complexes [M(H2O)6]n+ (for M = Ti to Zn), calculating Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ values for both transition metal and oxygen subspaces. We demonstrate that the conventional Hubbard $U$ formula, unlike the conventional DFT+$U$ method, incorporates interactions that are off-diagonal in the spin indices and places greater weight on one spin channel over the other. We employ and expand upon the minimum-tracking linear response method, which is shown to be numerically well-behaved even for closed-shell and near-filled subspaces such as in zinc. In such cases the $U$ value may become highly sensitive to the details of the subspace. We find that a Hubbard correction on the oxygen atoms is required in order to preserve bond lengths in these systems, while predicting spectroscopic properties appears beyond the reach of standard DFT+$U$ functionals. Finally, we demonstrate that the random-phase approximation does not accurately describe screening effects among different spins.
