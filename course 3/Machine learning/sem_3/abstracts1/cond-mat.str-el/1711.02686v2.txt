How to make a model of a non-Fermi-liquid metal with efficient current dissipation is a long-standing problem. Results from holographic duality suggest a framework where local critical fermionic degrees of freedom provide both a source of decoherence for the Landau quasiparticle, and a sink for its momentum. This leads us to study a Kondo lattice type model with SYK models in place of the spin impurities. We find evidence for a stable phase at intermediate couplings.
