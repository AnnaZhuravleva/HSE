We introduce a novel class of gapped three-dimensional models, dubbed "cage-net fracton models," which host immobile fracton excitations in addition to non-Abelian particles with restricted mobility. Starting from layers of two-dimensional string-net models, whose spectrum includes non-Abelian anyons, we condense extended one-dimensional "flux-strings" built out of point-like excitations. Flux-string condensation generalizes the concept of anyon condensation familiar from conventional topological order and allows us to establish properties of the fracton ordered (equivalently, flux-string condensed) phase, such as its ground state wave function and spectrum of excitations. Through the examples of doubled Ising and SU(2)$_k$ cage-net models, we explicitly demonstrate the existence of non-Abelian particles restricted to move only along one- or two-dimensions in the fracton phase, along with that of strictly immobile Abelian fractons. We further show that the ground state wave function of such phases can be understood as a fluctuating network of extended objects - cages - and strings, which we dub a cage-net condensate. Besides having implications for topological quantum computation in three dimensions, our work may also point the way towards more general insights into quantum phases of matter with fracton order.
