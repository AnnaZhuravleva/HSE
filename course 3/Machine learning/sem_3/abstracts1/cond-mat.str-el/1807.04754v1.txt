Building upon techniques employed in the construction of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is a solvable $0+1$ dimensional model of a non-Fermi liquid, we develop a solvable, infinite-ranged random-hopping model of fermions coupled to fluctuating U(1) gauge fields. In a specific large-$N$ limit, our model realizes a gapless non-Fermi liquid phase, which combines the effects of hopping and interaction terms. We derive the thermodynamic properties of the non-Fermi liquid phase realized by this model, and the charge transport properties of an infinite-dimensional version with spatial structure.
