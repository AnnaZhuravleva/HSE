Extracting meaningful physical information out of a many-body wavefunction is often impractical. The polynomial nature of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) wavefunctions, however, provides a rare opportunity for a study by virtue of ground states alone. In this article, we investigate the general properties of FQH ground state polynomials. It turns out that the data carried by an FQH ground state can be essentially that of a (small) directed graph/matrix. We establish a correspondence between FQH ground states, binary invariants and regular graphs and briefly introduce all the necessary concepts. Utilizing methods from invariant theory and graph theory, we will then take a fresh look on physical properties of interest, e.g. squeezing properties, clustering properties, etc. Our methodology allows us to `unify' almost all of the previously constructed FQH ground states in the literature as special cases of a graph-based class of model FQH ground states, which we call \emph{accordion} model FQH states.
