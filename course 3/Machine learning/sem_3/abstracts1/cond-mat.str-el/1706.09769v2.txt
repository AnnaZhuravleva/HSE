We review the dimensional reduction procedure in the group cohomology classification of bosonic SPT phases with finite abelian unitary symmetry group. We then extend this to include general reductions of arbitrary dimensions and also extend the procedure to fermionic SPT phases described by the Gu-Wen super-cohomology model. We then show that we can define topological invariants as partition functions on certain closed orientable/spin manifolds equipped with a flat connection. The invariants are able to distinguish all phases described within the respective models. Finally, we establish a connection to invariants obtained from braiding statistics of the corresponding gauged theories.
