The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a concrete model for non-Fermi Liquid with maximally chaotic behavior in $0+1$-$d$. In order to gain some insights into real materials in higher dimensions where fermions could hop between different sites, here we consider coupling a SYK lattice by a constant hopping. We call this dispersive SYK model. Focusing on $1+1$-$d$ homogeneous hopping, by either tuning temperature or the relative strength of random interaction (hopping) and constant hopping, we find a crossover between a dispersive metal to an incoherent metal, where dynamic exponent $z$ changes from $1$ to $\infty$. We study the crossover by calculating spectral function, charge density correlator and the Lyapunov exponent. We further find the Lyapunov exponent becomes larger when the chemical potential is tuned to approach a Van Hove singularity because of the large density of states near the Fermi suface. The effect of the topological non-trivial bands is also discussed.
