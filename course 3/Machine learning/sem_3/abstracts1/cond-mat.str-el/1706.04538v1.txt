Using a model-independent low-energy effective field theory, we calculate the free energy of three-dimensional antiferromagnets in a combination of mutually perpendicular external magnetic and staggered fields at the next-to-next-to-leading, two-loop order. Renormalization is carried out analytically, and the renormalization group invariance of the result is checked explicitly. The free energy is thus expressed solely in terms of temperature, the external fields, and a set of low-energy coupling constants, to be determined by experiment or by matching to the microscopic model of a given concrete material.
