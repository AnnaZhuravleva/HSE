We study the behaviour of the fidelity and the Uhlmann connection in two-dimensional systems of free-fermions that exhibit non-trivial topological behavior. In particular, we use the fidelity and a quantity closely related to the Uhlmann factor in order to detect phase transitions at zero and finite temperature for topological insulators and superconductors. We show that at zero temperature both quantities predict quantum phase transitions: a sudden drop of fidelity indicates an abrupt change of the spectrum of the state, while the behavior of the Uhlmann connection signals equally rapid change in its eigenbasis. At finite temperature, the topological features are gradually smeared out, showing the absence of finite-temperature phase transitions, which we further confirm by performing a detailed analysis of the edge states.
