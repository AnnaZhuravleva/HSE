Thermalisation is a probabilistic process. As such, it is generally expected that increasing the temperature of a quantum system reduces its correlation length and eventually brings the system towards its classical behaviour. By employing the Gibbs state of a translationally invariant quantum spin liquid -- Kitaev's honeycomb lattice model -- we demonstrate that an insulating phase at $T=0$ becomes metallic purely by increasing temperature. In particular, we compute its finite temperature distribution of energy and show that it diverges logarithmically, as we move to small energies. The corresponding wave functions become critical alike as at Anderson transitions. Our work opens the possibility to detect thermal metal behaviour in current spin liquid experiments.
