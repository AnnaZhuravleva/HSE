We evaluate the finite temperature partition sum and correlation functions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Starting from a recently proposed mapping of the SYK model onto Liouville quantum mechanics, we obtain our results by exact integration over conformal Goldstone modes reparameterizing physical time. Perhaps, the least expected result of our analysis is that at time scales proportional to the number of particles the out of time order correlation function crosses over from a regime of exponential decay to a universal $t^{-6}$ power-law behavior.
