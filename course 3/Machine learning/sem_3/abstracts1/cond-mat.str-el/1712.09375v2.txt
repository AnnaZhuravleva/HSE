We construct a new, two-parametric family of integrable models and reveal their underlying duality symmetry. A modular subgroup of this duality is shown to connect non-interacting modes of different systems. We apply the new solution and duality to a Richardson-Gaudin model and generate a novel integrable system termed the $s$-$d$ wave Richardson-Gaudin-Kitaev interacting chain, interpolating $s$- and $d$- wave superconductivity. The phase diagram of this model has a topological phase transition that can be connected to the duality, where the occupancy of the non-interacting mode serves as a topological order parameter.
