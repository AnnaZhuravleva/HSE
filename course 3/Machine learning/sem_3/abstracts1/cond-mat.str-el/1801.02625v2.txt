We consider the string-net model obtained from $SU(2)_2$ fusion rules. These fusion rules are shared by two different sets of anyon theories. In this work, we study the competition between the two corresponding non-Abelian quantum phases in the ladder geometry. A detailed symmetry analysis shows that the nontrivial low-energy sector corresponds to the transverse-field cluster model that displays a critical point described by the $so(2)_1$ conformal field theory. Other sectors are obtained by freezing spins in this model.
