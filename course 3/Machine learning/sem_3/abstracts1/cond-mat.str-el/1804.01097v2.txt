We study how quantum states are scrambled via braiding in systems of non-Abelian anyons through the lens of entanglement spectrum statistics. We define a distance between the entanglement level spacing distribution of a state evolved under random braids and that of a Haar-random state, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$. We study $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ numerically for random braids of Majorana fermions (supplemented with random local four-body interactions) and Fibonacci anyons. For comparison, we also obtain $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of Majorana fermions with all-to-all interactions, random unitary circuits built out of (a) Hadamard (H), $\pi/8$ (T), and CNOT gates, and (b) random unitary circuits built out of two-qubit Haar-random unitaries. We define as a universal clock the Page limit-normalized entanglement entropy $S/S_{\mathrm{max}}$, which allows us to compare all different models on equal footing. Our results reveal a hierarchy of scrambling among various models --- even for the same amount of entanglement entropy --- at intermediate times, whereas all models exhibit the same late-time behavior. In particular, we find that braiding of Fibonacci anyons scrambles faster than the universal H+T+CNOT set. Our results promote $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ as a quantifiable metric for scrambling and quantum chaos, which applies to generic quantum systems away from large-$N$ or semiclassical limits.
