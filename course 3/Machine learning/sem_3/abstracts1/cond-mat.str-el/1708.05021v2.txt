We discuss a method of numerically identifying exact energy eigenstates for a finite system, whose form can then be obtained analytically. We demonstrate our method by identifying and deriving exact analytic expressions for several excited states, including an infinite tower, of the one dimensional spin-1 AKLT model, a celebrated non-integrable model. The states thus obtained for the AKLT model can be interpreted as one-to-an extensive number of quasiparticles on the ground state or on the highest excited state when written in terms of dimers. Included in these exact states is a tower of states spanning energies from the ground state to the highest excited state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that exact analytic expressions for a tower of excited states have been found in non-integrable models. Some of the states of the tower appear to be in the bulk of the energy spectrum, allowing us to make conjectures on the strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We also generalize these exact states including the tower of states to the generalized integer spin AKLT models. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between some of our states and those of the Majumdar-Ghosh model, yet another non-integrable model, and extend our construction to the generalized integer spin AKLT models.
