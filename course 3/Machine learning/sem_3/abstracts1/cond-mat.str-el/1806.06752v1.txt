We show that the macroscopic magnetic and electronic properties of strongly correlated electron systems can be manipulated by coupling them to a cavity mode. As a paradigmatic example we consider the Fermi-Hubbard model and find that the electron-cavity coupling enhances the magnetic interaction between the electron spins in the ground-state manifold, introduces a next-nearest neighbour hopping and mediates a long-range electron-electron interaction between distant sites. In the manifold of states with one photon or one doublon excitation the cavity results in the formation of polariton branches. The vacuum Rabi splitting of the two outermost branches is collectively enhanced and can exceed the width of the first excited Hubbard band. The cavity-mediated modifications of the material properties in the ground and first excited manifolds can be experimentally observed via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and the optical conductivity, respectively.
