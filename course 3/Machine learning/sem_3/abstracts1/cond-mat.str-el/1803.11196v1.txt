We review what is known about fracton phases of quantum matter. Fracton phases are characterized by excitations that exhibit restricted mobility, being either immobile under local Hamiltonian dynamics, or mobile only in certain directions. They constitute a new class of quantum state of matter, which does not wholly fit into any of the existing paradigms, but which connects to areas including glassy quantum dynamics, topological order, spin liquids, elasticity theory, quantum information theory, and gravity. We begin by discussing gapped fracton phases, which may be described using exactly solvable lattice spin models. We introduce the basic phenomena, and discuss the geometric and topological response of fracton phases. We also discuss connections to generalized gauge theories, and explain how gapped fracton phases may be obtained from more familiar theories. We then introduce the framework of tensor gauge theory, which provides a powerful complementary perspective on fracton phases. We discuss how tensor gauge theory encodes the fracton phenomenon, and how it allows us to access gapless fracton phases. We discuss the basic properties of gapless fracton phases, and their connections to elasticity theory and gravity. We also discuss what is known about the dynamics and thermodynamics of fractons at non-zero density, before concluding with a brief survey of some open problems.
