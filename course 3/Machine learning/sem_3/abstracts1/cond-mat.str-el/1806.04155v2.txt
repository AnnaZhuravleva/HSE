The lattice construction of Euclidean path integrals has been a successful approach of deriving 2+1D field theory dualities with a U$(1)$ gauge field. In this work, we generalize this lattice construction to dualities with non-Abelian gauge fields. We construct the Euclidean spacetime lattice path integral for a theory with strongly-interacting $SO(3)$ vector bosons and Majorana fermions coupled to an $SO(3)$ gauge field and derive an exact duality between this theory and the theory of a free Majorana fermion on the spacetime lattice. We argue that this lattice duality implies the desired infrared duality between the field theory with an $SO(3)$ vector critical boson coupled to an $SO(3)_1$ Chern-Simons gauge theory, and a free massless Majorana fermion in 2+1D. We also generalize the lattice construction of dualities to models with $O(3)$ gauge fields.
