We study fermions in an electrically-probed and asymptotically anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild spacetime which interact via novel chiral symmetry-preserving interactions. Computing the dual fermion two-point correlator, we show that these bulk interactions anisotropically gap Fermi surfaces of the boundary spectrum. Consequently, the interactions we devise provide holographic models for Fermi arcs seen ubiquitously in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates. Our interactions are modifications of the chiral symmetry-breaking Pauli coupling, which has previously been proposed as the holographic realization of Mott physics. The onset of Mott insulation and pseudogap physics are respectively discussed in the context of bulk chiral and boundary parity symmetry breaking, and the Mott transition is interpreted as a deconfinement transition of non-Fermi liquid excitations.
