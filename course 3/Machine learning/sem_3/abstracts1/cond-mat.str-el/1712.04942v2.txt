Although quantum Hall plateau transitions have been the prime examples of quantum criticality in a disordered electron system for the past three decades, many questions remain unanswered. Scaling of the measured electrical conductivity in the vicinity of these transitions reveals the surprising phenomenon of superuniversality where different transitions appear to share the same correlation length and dynamical critical exponent. Previous theoretical studies of these transitions within the framework of Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter found critical exponents that appear to directly depend on the change of the Hall conductivity across a specific phase transition, in contrast to what is observed experimentally. Here, we use non-Abelian bosonization and modular transformations to investigate theoretically the phenomenon of superuniversality. Specifically, we introduce a new effective theory that has an emergent $U(N)$ gauge symmetry with $N > 1$ for a quantum phase transition between an integer quantum Hall state and an insulator. We then use modular transformations to generate from this theory new effective descriptions for transitions between a large class of fractional quantum Hall states whose quasiparticle excitations have Abelian statistics. In the 't Hooft large $N$ limit, the correlation length and dynamical critical exponents are independent of the particular transition. We argue that this superuniversality survives away from the large $N$ limit using recent duality conjectures.
