We consider exactly solvable models in (3+1)d whose ground states are described by topological lattice gauge theories. Using simplicial arguments, we emphasize how the consistency condition of the unitary map performing a local change of triangulation is equivalent to the coherence relation of the pentagonator 2-morphism of a monoidal 2-category. By weakening some axioms of such 2-category, we obtain a cohomological model whose underlying 1-category is a 2-group. Topological models from 2-groups together with their lattice realization are then studied from a higher gauge theory point of view. Symmetry protected topological phases protected by higher symmetry structures are explicitly constructed, and the gauging procedure which yields the corresponding topological gauge theories is discussed in detail. We finally study the correspondence between symmetry protected topological phases and t'Hooft anomalies in the context of these higher group symmetries.
