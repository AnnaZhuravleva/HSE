We consider the $d$-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with power-law interactions $J/r^{d+\sigma}$ in the presence of a noisy longitudinal field with zero average. We study the longitudinal-magnetization dynamics of an initial paramagnetic state after a sudden switch-on of both the interactions and the noisy field. While the system eventually relaxes to an infinite-temperature state with vanishing magnetization correlations, we find that two-time correlation functions show aging at intermediate times. Moreover, for times shorter than the inverse noise strength $\kappa$ and distances longer than $a(J/\kappa)^{2/\sigma}$ with $a$ being the lattice spacing, we find a critical scaling regime of correlation and response functions consistent with the model A dynamical universality class with an initial-slip exponent $\theta=1$ and dynamical critical exponent $z=\sigma/2$. We obtain our results analytically by deriving an effective action for the magnetization field including the noise in a non-perturbative way. The above scaling regime is governed by a non-equilibrium fixed point dominated by the noise fluctuations.
