It was recently shown that an interacting Kitaev topological superconductor model is exactly solvable based on two-step Jordan-Wigner transformations together with one spin rotation. We generalize this model by including the dimerization, which is shown also to be exactly solvable. We analytically determine the topological phase diagram containing seven distinct phases. It is argued that the system is topological when a fermionic many-body Majorana zero-energy edge state emerges. It is intriguing that there are two tetra-critical points, at each of which four distinct phases touch.
