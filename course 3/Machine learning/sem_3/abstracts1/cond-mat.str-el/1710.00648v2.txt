We investigate the influence of self-energy diagrams beyond the two-particle vertex level within dual fermion theory. Specifically, we calculate the local three-particle vertex and construct from it selected dual fermion self-energy corrections to dynamical mean field theory. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the thus obtained self-energy corrections are small in the parameter space where dual fermion corrections based on the two-particle vertex only are small. However, in other parts of the parameter space, they are of a similar magnitude and qualitatively different from standard dual fermion theory. The high-frequency behaviour of the self-energy correction is - surprisingly - even dominated by corrections stemming from the three-particle vertex.
