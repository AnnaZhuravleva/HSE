We show that the fermionic and bosonic spectrum of $d=2$ fermions at finite density coupled to a critical boson can be determined non-perturbatively in the combined limit $k_F\rightarrow {\infty}$, $N_f \rightarrow 0$ with $N_fk_F$ fixed. In this double scaling limit, the boson two-point function is corrected, but only at one-loop. This double scaling limit therefore incorporates the leading effect of Landau damping. The fermion two-point function is determined analytically in real space and numerically in (Euclidean) momentum space. The resulting spectrum is discontinuously connected to the quenched $N_f\rightarrow 0$ result. For $\omega \rightarrow 0$ with $k$ fixed the spectrum exhibits the distinct non-Fermi-liquid behavior previously surmised from the RPA approximation. However, the exact answer obtained here shows that the RPA result does not fully capture the IR of the theory.
