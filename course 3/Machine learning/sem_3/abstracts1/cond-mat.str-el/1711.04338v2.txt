We study a model in 1+2 dimensions composed of a spherical Fermi surface of $N_f$ flavors of fermions coupled to a massless scalar. We present a framework to non-perturbatively calculate general fermion $n$-point functions of this theory in the limit $N_f\rightarrow0$ followed by $k_F\rightarrow\infty$ where $k_F$ sets both the size and curvature of the Fermi surface. Using this framework we calculate the zero-temperature fermion density-density correlation function in real space and find an exponential decay of Friedel oscillations.
