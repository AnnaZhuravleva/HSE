Motivated by previous efforts in detecting topological orders from the ground state(s) wave function, we introduce a new quantum information tool, coined the information convex, to capture the bulk and boundary topological excitations of a 2D topological order. Defined as a set of reduced density matrices that minimizes the energy in a subsystem, the information convex encodes not only the bulk anyons but also the gapped boundaries of 2D topological orders. Using untwisted gapped boundaries of non-Abelian quantum doubles as an example, we show how the information convex reveal and characterize deconfined bulk and boundary topological excitations, and the condensation rule relating them. Interference experiments in cold atoms provide potential measurements for the invariant structure of information convex.
