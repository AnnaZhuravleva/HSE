The deconfined quantum critical point (QCP), separating the N\'eel and valence bond solid phases in a 2D antiferromagnet, was proposed as an example of $2+1$D criticality fundamentally different from standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher {criticality}. In this work we present multiple equivalent descriptions of deconfined QCPs, and use these to address the possibility of enlarged emergent symmetries in the low energy limit. The easy-plane deconfined QCP, besides its previously discussed self-duality, is dual to $N_f = 2$ fermionic quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has its own self-duality and hence may have an O(4)$\times Z_2^T$ symmetry. We propose several dualities for the deconfined QCP with ${\mathrm{SU}(2)}$ spin symmetry which together make natural the emergence of a previously suggested $SO(5)$ symmetry rotating the N\'eel and VBS orders. These emergent symmetries are implemented anomalously. The associated infra-red theories can also be viewed as surface descriptions of 3+1D topological paramagnets, giving further insight into the dualities. We describe a number of numerical tests of these dualities. We also discuss the possibility of "pseudocritical" behavior for deconfined critical points, and the meaning of the dualities and emergent symmetries in such a scenario.
