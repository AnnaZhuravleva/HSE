The Chebyshev expansion offers a numerically efficient and easy-implement algorithm for evaluating dynamic correlation functions using matrix product states (MPS). In this approach, each recursively generated Chebyshev vector is approximately represented by an MPS. However, the recurrence relations of Chebyshev polynomials are broken by the approximation, leading to an error which is accumulated with the increase of the order of expansion. Here we propose a reorthonormalization approach to remove this error introduced in the loss of orthogonality of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our approach, as illustrated by comparison with the exact results for the one-dimensional XY and Heisenberg models, improves significantly the accuracy in the calculation of dynamical correlation functions.
