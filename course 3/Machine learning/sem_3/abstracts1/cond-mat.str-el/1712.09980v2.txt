Considering quantum Hall states on geometric backgrounds has proved over the past few years to be a useful tool for uncovering their less evident properties, such as gravitational and electromagnetic responses, topological phases and novel geometric adiabatic transport coefficients. One of the transport coefficients, the central charge associated with the gravitational anomaly, appears as a Chern number for the adiabatic transport on the moduli spaces of higher genus Riemann surfaces. This calls for a better understanding of the QH states on these backgrounds. Here we give a detailed account of the construction of Laughlin states on Riemann surfaces of genus ${\rm g}>1$. We present a rigorous definition of the Laughlin states and their explicit construction, based on the path integral for the 2d bosonic field compactified on a circle, reproducing the conjectured $\beta^{\rm g}$-fold degeneracy for the filling fraction $\nu=1/\beta$. We also discuss the lowest Landau level, integer QH state and its relation to the bosonization formulas on higher genus Riemann surfaces.
