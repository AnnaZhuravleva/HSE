Fractional excitations in fracton models exhibit novel features not present in conventional topological phases: their mobility is constrained, there are an infinitude of types, and they bear an exotic sense of 'braiding'. Hence, they require a new framework for proper characterization. Based on our definition of foliated fracton phases in which equivalence between models includes the possibility of adding layers of gapped 2D states, we propose to characterize fractional excitations in these phases up to the addition of quasiparticles with 2D mobility. That is, two quasiparticles differing by a set of quasiparticles that move along 2D planes are considered to be equivalent; likewise, 'braiding' statistics are measured in a way that is insensitive to the attachment of 2D quasiparticles. The fractional excitation types and statistics defined in this way provide a universal characterization of the underlying foliated fracton order which can subsequently be used to establish phase relations. We demonstrate as an example the equivalence between the X-cube model and the semionic X-cube model both in terms of fractional excitations and through an exact mapping.
