We describe a 3d analog of the Jordan-Wigner transformation which maps an arbitrary fermionic system on a 3d spatial lattice to a 2-form $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with an unusual Gauss law. An important property of this map is that it preserves the locality of the Hamiltonian. We give examples of 3d bosonic systems dual to free fermions and describe the corresponding 4D Euclidean lattice models.
