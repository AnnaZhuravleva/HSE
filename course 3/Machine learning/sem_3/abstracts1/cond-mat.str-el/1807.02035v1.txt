Fermions with one and two Dirac nodes are coupled to in-plane phonons to study a spontaneous transition into the Hall insulating phase. At sufficiently strong electron-phonon interaction a gap appears in the spectrum of fermions, signaling a transition into a phase with spontaneously broken parity and time-reversal symmetry. The structure of elementary excitations above the gap in the corresponding phase reveals the presence of scale invariant parity breaking terms which resemble Chern-Simons excitations. Evaluating the Kubo formula for both models we find quantized Hall plateaux in each case, with conductance of binodal model exactly twice as large as of the mononodal model.
