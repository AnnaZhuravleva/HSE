Entanglement has developed into an essential concept for the characterization of phases and phase transitions in ground states of quantum many-body systems. In this work, we use the logarithmic negativity to study the spatial entanglement structure in the transverse-field Ising chain both in the ground state and at nonzero temperatures. Specifically, we investigate the entanglement between two disjoint blocks as a function of their separation, which can be viewed as the entanglement analog of a spatial correlation function. We find sharp entanglement thresholds at a critical distance beyond which the logarithmic negativity vanishes exactly and thus the two blocks become unentangled, which holds even in the presence of long-ranged quantum correlations, i.e., at the system's quantum critical point. Using Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD), we explore this feature as a function of temperature and size of the two blocks and present a simple model to describe our numerical observations.
