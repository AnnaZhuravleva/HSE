In this paper we consider modification of electronic properties of graphene-based topological insulator in the presence of wedge disclination and magnetic field by adopting the Kane-Mele model with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Using the properly defined Dirac-Weyl equation for this system, an exact solution for the Landau levels is obtained. The influence of the topological defect on the evolution of Landau levels is discussed.
