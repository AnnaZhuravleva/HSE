We describe the phonon structure of GH$^2$ composite fermions (CF), identify $N,L,m,m_\nu$ as their quantum numbers, and provide equivalent CF and hierarchical forms for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) wave functions. The second magnetic quantum label $m_\nu$ ($\nu$-spin), the number difference of CF electron and vortex phonons, allows one to group all FQHE states into mirror-symmetric multiplets of constant $N$, symmetric around the half-filled shell ($m_\nu=0$). States of fixed electron number $N$ but distinct fillings $\nu = p/(2p+1)$ and $\bar{\nu}= p/(2p-1)$, e.g., $2/5 \leftrightarrow 2/3$, differ only by conjugation of the valence electron phonons $\boldsymbol{b}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \boldsymbol{\tilde{b}}$ of their respective CFs.   Particle-hole (PH) symmetry connects states of distinct $N$ and $\bar{N}^\mathrm{PH}$ residing in a fixed magnetic field $S$, with $\nu=p/(2p+1)$ and $\bar{\nu}^\mathrm{PH}=(p+1)/(2p+1)$, e.g., $2/5 \leftrightarrow 3/5$. We show that these states are related by electron-vortex conjugation, the valence phonon exchange $\boldsymbol{b}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \boldsymbol{v}^\dagger$, apart from an exceptional zero-mode subshell for the $\bar{\nu}^\mathrm{PH}>{1\over 2}$ state, occupied by $\bar{N}-N$ Laughlin-type CFs.   We argue that the CF Pauli Hamiltonian is isospectral, quadratic in the $\nu$-spin raising and lowering operators $\hat{S}^\nu_\pm$, and four-fold degenerate. On linearization, it takes a Dirac form familiar from the IQHE. We discuss the mass term as well as possible connections with Son's work.
