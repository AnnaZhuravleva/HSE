# Queue with Precomputed Maximum

`MaxQueue` is a FIFO queue that allows fast queries for the maximum among currently enqueued elements.

You have to implement all its methods: `Push()`, `Pop()`, and `Max()`.

`Max()` must have a **guaranteed** time complexity `O(1)`. `Push()` and `Pop()` are allowed to run in `O(1)` time in **amortised** sense.
